## **PREPARE Phase**

#### Data Source
The data is stored on Kaggle from the dataset *FitBit Fitness Tracker Data*. The dataset is under the licence *CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication* and it was made available through Mobius. 

#### Data Information

This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

The data is saved in 18 CSV files

heartrate_seconds_merged.csv: Tranformation:
I had the same error. The original CSV file has a timestamp that is not compatible with SQL. The timestamp needs to be in this format: yy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
In order to change the format I had to save the CSV file as an excel file then change the format of that column and save it. Then I saved a copy of the corrected spreadsheet as a CSV file. Was able to upload it to BigQuery after that.
