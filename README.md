#### Data Source
The data is stored on Kaggle from the dataset *FitBit Fitness Tracker Data*. The dataset is under the licence *CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication* and it was made available through Mobius. 

#### Data Information

The dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.

#### Data Privacy and Accessibility

The data is structured and mostly in long data format, 3 out of 18 files are organized in wide format.
It is a secondary data source gathered by Mobius.

Based on the metadata, the data is an open source which is protected under copyrght law through the *CC0: Public Domain* license.
We are allowed to copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, all without asking permission.

There will be limitations to the reliability of the analysis due to the sample size (33 users) and the short time period (2 months) which could create biased results. 
Moreover, the four files below will be excluded by default from the analysis because their sample size is too small compared to the other files (less than 33 Id):
- heartrate_seconds_merged.csv (14 users)
- weightLogInfo_merged.csv (8 users)

#### Data Integrity

Some files were too big to be opened in spreadsheets and display all the datasets, thus the data has been verified in R Cloud.

The files provide information in days, hours and minutes. We'll focus our analysis on the daily basis. Although "sleepDay_merged.csv" file has collected data for only 24 users 9 vs. 33 total users), we'll exceptionnally keep this file in the analysis 

## **PROCESS Phase**

R Studio has been choosen to process this analysis as it allows the user to perform all the phases in one tool (Preparation, Process, Analysis, Share).
amount of data.


The data sets will require some data cleaning to facilitate the analysis: 

This is an example of the reproducible code for the data verification based on *dailyActivity_merged.csv* file 

Id check
Data range check
No null data
No duplicates

```{r} Daily_Activity <- read_csv("Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16/dailyActivity_merged.csv") ```
